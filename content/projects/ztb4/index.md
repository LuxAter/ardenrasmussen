TRM (Tiny Ray Marcher) is a C++ project that implement a very small ray
marching algorithm. The project implements the fundamental components of a path
tracer, and even provides an easy to use scene definition file.

#### Efficiency

By changing specific key configuration values in a rendered image, it is
possible to significantly alter the quality of the image, in direct relation to
the runtime of the program. However some settings will produce a better output
image, for less cost to runtime. The main two settings that we consider here,
is the **spp** and the **resolution**. By doubling the spp it can be considered
that we are rendering twice as many images, and combining the images after the
fact. While doubling the resolution is equivalent to rendering four times the
number of images, and connecting the images as the four quadrants of the output
image.

After collecting the data it is clear that doubling the resolution in both axis
is indeed about equivalent to four times the samples per pixel. However,
increasing the resolution produces a visually shaper images, even with very few
samples.

> [!NOTE]
> More quantitative data is still being determined.

#### Configuration

The scene file is based upon JSON file format. The general file is formatted
like so:

```cpp
{
  "spp": 128,
  "maxiumumDepth": 64,
  "resolution": [2000, 2000],
  "camera": {
    "fov": 1.5707,
    "center": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
    "up": [0.0, 1.0, 0.0],
    "pos": [0.0, 0.0, -6.0]
  },
  "materials": {
    ...
  },
  "objects": {
    ...
  }
}
```

##### General

These are general settings for the render, they control how the renderer will
function, and the quality of the produced image. Changing these values will
significantly impact the runtime of the renderer. The amount that each value
effects the runtime is described in the section on [Efficiency](#efficiency).

| Value           | Description                                                                             |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `spp`           | The number of samples per pixel. Higher values will result in better looking images.    |
| `maximumDepth`  | The number of bounces that the simulation will simulate before rays begin to terminate. |
| `resolution`    | The width and height of the output image.                                               |
| `camera`        | Information about the camera object in the scene.                                       |
| `camera.fov`    | The field of view for the camera given in radians.                                      |
| `camera.center` | The point in the scene that the camera will be focused at.                              |
| `camera.up`     | The direction that will be the up direction relative to the camera.                     |
| `camera.pos`    | The position of the camera object in the scene.                                         |
